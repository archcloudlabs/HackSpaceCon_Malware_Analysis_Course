## About The Course

Do you have the desire to grow your skills in Malware Analysis, RE, and Software Engineering  beyond just following tutorials?

[Arch Cloud Labs](https://www.archcloudlabs.com) was built on honeypots and analyzing malware samples in a homelab environment to create a unique way to build those skills.

This course offers a quick taste of building malware analysis pipeline in your homelab to recreate analysis done by large firms as well as inspire you to do analysis of your own.

Each section is designed to get you started, and then leave you with questions to go and explore on your own.

This combination of guided and experimental learning has been successful for previous courses, and Arch Cloud Labs hopes you find it enjoyable. 

This repo is Apache2 licensed, and dedicated to all those that have contributed malware samples, blogs, tweets, YouTube videos, Conference Talks, etc... thank you for your contributions.
